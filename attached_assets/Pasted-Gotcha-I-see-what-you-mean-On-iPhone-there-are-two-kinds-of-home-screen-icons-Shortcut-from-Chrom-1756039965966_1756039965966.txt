Gotcha—I see what you mean. On iPhone there are two kinds of home-screen icons:

Shortcut from Chrome (or any non-Safari browser): just opens that browser with full UI (URL bar, tabs).

Installed web app (PWA) from Safari: opens standalone with no browser chrome—looks like a real app. That’s what your “Finances” one is.

To make your app behave like #2 every time, do this:

A) Make sure your site is “installable”

Add these once to your repo (then redeploy):

Manifest at the site root
static/manifest.webmanifest

{
  "name": "Portfolio Tracker",
  "short_name": "Portfolio",
  "start_url": "/",
  "scope": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#000000",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "icons": [
    {"src": "/static/icons/icon-192.png","sizes":"192x192","type":"image/png"},
    {"src": "/static/icons/icon-512.png","sizes":"512x512","type":"image/png"}
  ]
}

Serve manifest + service worker from the root scope

# in app.py
from flask import send_from_directory

@app.route("/manifest.webmanifest")
def manifest():
    return send_from_directory("static", "manifest.webmanifest",
                               mimetype="application/manifest+json")

@app.route("/service-worker.js")
def sw():
    return send_from_directory("static", "service-worker.js",
                               mimetype="application/javascript")


static/service-worker.js (minimal is fine; helps some installers):

self.addEventListener('install', e => {
  e.waitUntil(caches.open('v1').then(c => c.addAll(['/'])));
});
self.addEventListener('fetch', e => {
  e.respondWith(fetch(e.request).catch(() => caches.match(e.request)));
});


Link in your base HTML <head>

<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/static/icons/apple-touch-icon.png">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="default">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000">
<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');
  }
</script>


Tip: Make sure your first page doesn’t redirect to a different domain. Redirecting to another host on first load can force iOS to open the browser.

B) Install it the correct way

Use Safari (not Chrome) and open your app’s URL (your Render domain or your custom domain).

Pull-to-refresh once.

Tap Share → Add to Home Screen → Add.

Delete any old icon you added via Chrome—those always open Chrome.

Now launch the new icon: it should open without the URL bar or browser controls.

C) If it still opens with browser UI, check these

Visit these URLs and confirm they load:
https://yourdomain/manifest.webmanifest and https://yourdomain/service-worker.js.

In your manifest, display must be "standalone", and start_url should be / (or a path on the same origin).

Clear old site data and re-add: iOS Settings → Safari → Advanced → Website Data → search your domain → Remove, then repeat the install steps above.

Do the steps above once and you’ll get the same “standalone app” experience as your existing Finances icon.
