Net Worth Tracker With Monthly Breakdown
I want to build a full-featured web app on Replit to replace my detailed Google Sheets net worth and finance tracker. The app will log my net worth over time, track investments, and include a monthly breakdown of income, expenses, and investments — with automatic calculations and consistent formatting.

🧩 Modules Required in the App
1. Dashboard
Shows:

Current net worth

Percentage allocation across platforms

Month-on-month % change

Year-on-year growth

2. 2025 Tracker Page
Table with:

Each investment and cash value per month (Jan–Dec)

Total actual net worth per month

Monthly percentage change

Yearly % increase at end

3. Income vs Investment Tracker
Yearly summary table (2017–2025):

Edit
Year | Take Home Income | Amount Invested | % of Income Invested
Includes a total row at the bottom

4. Monthly Breakdown Page (based on uploaded image)
Income Section:

Monthly take-home income

Annual take-home income (auto-calculated)

Expenses Table:

Columns: Expense, Monthly, Annual

Auto-totalled monthly and annual expenses

Investments Table:

Grouped by platform (e.g., Crypto, Trading212, InvestEngine ISA, etc.)

Each group contains individual investments (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, Solana)

Fields:

% of income

Monthly amount

Annual amount

Free Cash Summary (Top of Page):

Free cash = Income − (Expenses + Investments)

Display both monthly and annual free cash amounts

5. Investment Manager
Add, edit, or remove:

Investment names

Monthly contribution values

Group/platform they belong to

Color tags for visual consistency

6. Live Price Updater
Uses APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or similar to fetch:

Stock, ETF, and crypto prices

Mutual fund prices including:

Baillie Gifford Positive Change B - Acc

Fidelity Global Technology W - Acc

Ninety One GSF Global Natural Resources I - Acc

UBS S&P 500 Index C - Acc

Platform	Color
Degiro	Dark Blue
Trading212 ISA	Teal
EQ (GSK shares)	Red
InvestEngine ISA	Orange

Use these consistently across tables and UI elements.

⚙️ Suggested Stack
Frontend: HTML + Tailwind CSS (for color coding and responsive layout)
